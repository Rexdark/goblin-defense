# Goblin Defense (Demo)

**Goblin Defense** is a tower defense game currently in development. The game is in its **demo** stage, and many features are still incomplete. Please note that this is a work in progress, and some elements are not yet fully functional.

## Features (Demo Version)

- **Build Towers**: Players can place towers to defend against waves of goblins. However, at the moment, you can only build one tower per turn.
- **Wave Defense**: Face off against waves of goblins that aim to reach the goal. Your goal is to stop them by placing the right towers strategically.
- **Lose Condition**: If 20 goblins manage to reach the goal, you lose the game.
  
## Known Limitations

- **Save/Load Functionality**: The save/load feature is not fully implemented yet. Saving your progress might not work as expected.
- **Sound**: Currently, there is no sound in the game.
